This step specifies the input data source (e.g., path on shared FS/MinIO), the target LLM (e.g., OpenAI model name or internal service endpoint), the prompt, and potentially the output format. Scheduling: The Scheduler assigns this step to a Runi Agent. If targeting an internal LLM requiring specific hardware (GPU), the scheduler uses node resource information (reported by Agents) for placement. Execution: The Runi Agent launches a Worker Slice Process for this step. Credentials: The Worker Slice receives necessary credentials (e.g., OpenAI API key, MinIO access key) securely via the Secrets Manager. LLM Call: The worker reads input data, constructs the prompt, calls the relevant LLM API (external or internal), potentially handling batching or retries. Metadata Persistence: Upon receiving results, the worker extracts the annotations, formats them according to the Data Governance Service schema, and sends them via gRPC call to the service, linking them to the input data reference. It also reports standard lineage (input data -\u003e LLM step -\u003e annotations). Usage: Downstream pipeline steps or external users can then query the Data Governance Service (via API Server) to retrieve these annotations for further processing, reporting, or analysis.

API Server / RBAC: Enforces RBAC policies based on user/service account permissions within a target Herd. Cluster State Store: Explicitly stores Herd definitions and their associated resource quotas. Scheduler: Considers Herd-level quotas when making placement decisions. Secrets Manager: Access to secrets might be scoped by Herd. Data Governance: Metadata (lineage, annotations) can be tagged by or associated with the Herd it belongs to. Runi Agent: Receives the target Herd context when launching a slice and uses this information to potentially configure namespaces and apply appropriate cgroup limits based on Herd quotas. Runi Slice: A single instance of a pipeline step running as an isolated Worker Slice Process. Executes entirely within the logical boundary and resource constraints defined by its assigned Herd. Runi Pipes: Primarily used now for internal communication within the Runi Agent to capture logs/stdio from the Runi Slice it execs, rather than for primary data transfer between steps. Herd: A logical grouping construct, similar to a Kubernetes Namespace, enforced via RBAC policies and potentially mapped to specific sets of Linux namespaces managed by Agents. Provides multi-tenancy and team isolation. Quotas can be applied per Herd. Go Native \u0026 Linux Primitives: Core components written in Go, directly leveraging cgroups, namespaces (user, pid, net, mount, uts, ipc), pipes, sockets, and exec for execution and isolation. Self-Contained Cluster Management: Manages a pool of physical or virtual machines, schedules workloads onto them, and handles node lifecycle. Serverless Execution Model: Users define pipelines and resource requests; Runink manages node allocation, scheduling, isolation, scaling (by launching more slices), and lifecycle. Users are subject to quotas managed via cgroups. Security First: Integrated identity (OIDC), RBAC, secrets management, network policies, encryption in transit/rest. Data Governance Aware: Built-in metadata tracking, lineage capture, and support for quality checks. With extension for storage/management of rich data annotations (e.g., from LLMs). Rich Observability: Native support for metrics (Prometheus) and logs (Fluentd). ","programming-approaches-why-they-power-runink#Programming Approaches: Why They Power Runink":"Runink’s architecture isn’t just Go-native — it’s intentionally designed around a few low-level but high-impact programming paradigms. These concepts are what let Runink outperform containerized stacks, enforce security without overhead, and keep pipelines testable, composable, and fast. Runink takes a radically different approach to pipeline execution than traditional data platforms — instead of running heavy containers, JVMs, or external orchestrators, Runink uses Go-native workers, Linux primitives like cgroups and namespaces, and concepts like data-oriented design and zero-copy streaming to deliver blazing-fast, memory-stable, and secure slices.\nBelow, we walk through the four core techniques and where they show up in Runink’s components.\n🔄 1. Functional Pipelines “Like talking how your data flow over high-level functions.”\nRunink’s .dsl compiles to Go transforms that behave like pure functions: they take input (usually via io.Reader), apply a deterministic transformation, and emit output (via io.Writer). There’s no shared mutable state, no side effects — just clear dataflow.\nThis makes pipelines:\nComposable: steps can be reused across domains Testable: golden tests assert input/output correctness Deterministic: behavior doesn’t depend on cluster state ✅ Why it matters: It brings unit testability and DAG clarity to data pipelines — without needing a centralized scheduler or stateful orchestrator.\n2. Data-Oriented Design (DOD) “Design for the CPU, not the developer.”\nInstead of modeling data as deeply nested structs or objects, Runink favors flat, contiguous Go structs. This aligns memory layout with CPU cache lines and avoids heap thrashing. This is especially important for Runink’s slice execution and contract validation stages, where predictable access to batches of structs (records) matters.\nContracts are validated by scanning []struct batches in tight loops. Pointers and indirection are minimized for GC performance. Contracts power both validation and golden test generation. Use slices of structs over slices of pointers to enable CPU cache locality. Align field access with columnar memory usage if streaming transforms run across many rows. Preallocate buffers in Runi Agent’s slice execution path to avoid GC churn. Core Idea: Layout memory for how it will be accessed, not how it’s logically grouped. Runink’s slices often scan, validate, or enrich large batches of records — so struct layout, batching, and memory predictability directly impact performance.\nApply DOD in Runink: Prefer flat structs over nested ones in contracts: // Better type User struct { ID string Name string Email string } // Avoid: nested fields unless necessary type User struct { Meta struct { ID string } Profile struct { Name string Email string } } In runi slice: Use sync.Pool for reusable buffers (especially JSON decoding). Pre-size buffers based on contract hints (e.g., maxRecords=10000). Avoid interface{} — use generated structs via go/types or go:generate. Benefits: Better memory throughput, fewer allocations, and Go GC-friendliness under load. Use structs of arrays (SoA) or []User with preallocated slices in transformations. Minimize pointer indirection. Use value receivers and avoid *string, *int unless you need nil. Design transforms that operate in tight loops, e.g., for _, rec := range batch. Go structs are faster to iterate over than Python dictionaries or Java POJOs. Access patterns align with how CPUs fetch and cache data. Contract validation and transforms run over preallocated []struct batches, not heap-bound objects. 💡 For Python/Java devs: Think of this like switching from dicts of dicts to NumPy-like flat arrays — but in Go, with static types and no GC spikes.\n✅ Why it matters: You get predictable memory use and cache-friendly validation at slice scale — perfect for CPU-bound ETL or large-batch processing.\n3. Zero-Copy and Streaming Pipelines “Avoid full in-memory materialization — process as the data flows.”\nInstead of []record → transform → []record, Runink pipelines follow stream → transform → stream — minimizing allocations and maximizing throughput. Avoid unnecessary data marshaling or full deserialization. Rely on:\nTransforms consume from io.Reader and emit to io.Writer. Stages communicate via os.Pipe(), net.Pipe(), or chan Record for intra-slice streaming. Only materialize records when needed for validation or transformation. Intermediate results never fully materialize in memory. Core Idea: Instead of []Record -\u003e Transform -\u003e []Record, operate on streams of bytes or structs using io.Reader, chan Record, or even UNIX pipes between stages.\nRunink Optimizations: Use io.Reader → Decoder → Transform → Encoder → io.Writer chain.\nDesign step transforms like this:\nfunc ValidateUser(r io.Reader, w io.Writer) error { decoder := json.NewDecoder(r) encoder := json.NewEncoder(w) for decoder.More() { var user contracts.User if err := decoder.Decode(\u0026user); err != nil { return err } if isValid(user) { encoder.Encode(user) } } return nil } For multi-stage slices, use os.Pipe():\nr1, w1 := os.Pipe() r2, w2 := os.Pipe() go Normalize(r0, w1) // input -\u003e step 1 go Enrich(r1, w2) // step 1 -\u003e step 2 go Sink(r2, out) // step 2 -\u003e sink Benefits: Constant memory even for massive datasets. Backpressure: If downstream slows down, upstream blocks — great for streaming (Kafka, etc.). Enables DLQ teeing: tee := io.MultiWriter(validOut, dlqSink). Uses io.Reader / io.Writer rather than buffering everything in memory. Transforms run as pipes between goroutines — like UNIX but typed. Memory stays flat, predictable, and bounded — even for 10M+ record streams. 💡 For pandas/Spark devs: This is closer to generator pipelines or structured stream micro-batches, but with Go’s backpressure-aware channels and streaming codecs.\n✅ Why it matters: You can process unbounded streams or 100GB batch files with a stable memory footprint — and gain built-in backpressure and DLQ support.\n4. Declarative Scheduling with Constraint Propagation “Schedule via logic, not instructions.” The Herd and Runi Agent coordination already benefits from Raft-backed state, but push it further with affinity-aware, declarative scheduling:\nRunink doesn’t assign slices imperatively. It solves where to run things, based on:\nIsolation: @herd(\"analytics\") Define resource constraints (e.g., @requires(cpu=2, memory=512Mi, label=“gpu”)) in .dsl. Placement: @affinity(colocate_with=\"step:Join\") Propagate slice placement decisions through constraint-solving logic instead of imperative scheduling. Record constraints in the Raft-backed state store to enforce deterministic task placement. You can build this as a small DSL-on-DSL layer (e.g. @affinity(domain=\"finance\", colocate_with=\"step:JoinUsers\")).\nBenefit: Stronger determinism, replayability, and multi-tenant safety.\nCore Idea: Model placement as a set of constraints: affinity, herd quota, GPU needs, tenant isolation, etc. Let the scheduler solve the placement rather than being told where to run.\nRunink DSL Extension: In .dsl:\n@step(\"RunLLMValidation\") @affinity(label=\"gpu\", colocate_with=\"step:ParsePDFs\") @requires(cpu=\"4\", memory=\"2Gi\") This can be compiled into metadata stored in the Raft-backed scheduler store.\nScheduler Logic (Pseudo-Go): type Constraints struct { CPU int Memory int Affinity string Colocate string HerdScope string } func ScheduleStep(stepID string, constraints Constraints) (NodeID, error) { candidates := filterByHerd(constraints.HerdScope) candidates = filterByResources(candidates, constraints.CPU, constraints.Memory) if constraints.Colocate != \"\" { candidates = colocateWith(candidates, constraints.Colocate) } if constraints.Affinity != \"\" { candidates = matchLabel(candidates, constraints.Affinity) } return pickBest(candidates) } These constraints are stored in the Raft-backed Barn and evaluated by the scheduler. In this sense, all decisions are Raft-logged, making slice scheduling auditable and replayable.\n💡 If you’re used to Kubernetes or Docker: Think of slices as ephemeral containers, but 10x faster — no image pulls, no pod scheduling latency. No containers, no clusters — just data pipelines that behave like code.\n✅ Why it matters: Runink achieves multi-tenant safety, fault-tolerant execution, and reproducible placement — without complex K8s YAML or retries.\nSummary Table Approach Use In Runink Why It Powers Runink Functional Pipelines .dsl → Go transforms via @step() Clear transforms, reusable logic, golden testing Data-Oriented Design Contract enforcement, slice internals Memory locality, low-GC, CPU-efficient pipelines Zero-Copy Streaming Slice-to-slice transport, pipe-to-pipe steps Constant memory, streaming support, low latency Declarative Scheduling Herd quotas + slice placement affinity in .dsl raft store Deterministic, fair, replayable orchestration ","runink-architecture-golinux-native-distributed-data-environment#Runink Architecture: Go/Linux Native Distributed Data Environment":"Runink Architecture: Go/Linux Native Distributed Data EnvironmentSelf-sufficient, distributed environment for orchestrating and executing data pipelines using Go and Linux primitives.

Architecture \u0026 Paradigm Runink: A Go/Linux-native, vertically integrated data platform that combines execution, scheduling, governance, and observability in a single runtime. Unlike traditional stacks, Runink does not rely on Kubernetes or external orchestrators. Instead, it uses a Raft-based control plane to ensure high availability and consensus across services like scheduling, metadata, and security — forming a distributed operating model purpose-built for data.\nCompetitors: Use a layered, loosely coupled stack:\nExecution: Spark, Beam (JVM-based) Orchestration: Airflow, Dagster (often on Kubernetes) Transformation: DBT (runs SQL on external data platforms) Cluster Management: Kubernetes, Slurm Governance: Collibra, Apache Atlas (external) Key Differentiator: Runink is built from the ground up as a distributed system — with Raft consensus at its core — whereas competitors compose multiple tools that communicate asynchronously or rely on external state systems.\n1. MapReduce vs. RDD vs. Raft for Data Pipelines 1.1 Architecture \u0026 Paradigm Aspect MapReduce RDD Raft (Runink model) Origin Google (2004) Spark (2010) Raft (2013) adapted for distributed control Execution Model Batch, two-stage (Map → Reduce) In-memory DAGs of transformations Real-time coordination of distributed nodes Consistency Model Eventual (job outputs persisted) Best effort (job outputs in memory, lineage for recovery) Strong consistency (N/2+1 consensus) Primary Use Large batch analytics Interactive, iterative analytics Distributed metadata/state management for pipelines Fault Tolerance Output checkpointing Lineage-based recomputation Log replication and state machine replication 1.2. Performance \u0026 Efficiency Aspect MapReduce RDD Raft (Runink) Cold Start Time High (JVM startup, slot allocation) Medium (Spark cluster overhead) Low (Go processes, native scheduling) Memory Use Disk-heavy Memory-heavy (RDD caching) Lightweight (control metadata, not bulk data) I/O Overhead Heavy disk I/O (HDFS reads/writes) Network/memory optimized, but needs enough RAM Minimal (only metadata replication) Pipeline Complexity Requires multiple jobs for DAGs Natural DAG execution Direct DAG compilation from DSLs (Runink) 1.3. Data Governance and Lineage Aspect MapReduce RDD Raft (Runink) Built-in Lineage No (external) Yes (RDD lineage graph) Yes (atomic commit of contracts, steps, runs) Governance APIs Manual (logs, job output) Partial (Spark listeners) Native (contracts, lineage logs, per-slice metadata) Auditability Hard to reconstruct Possible with effort Native per-run audit logs, Raft-signed events 1.4. Fault Tolerance and Recovery Aspect MapReduce RDD Raft (Runink) Recovery Mechanism Re-run failed jobs Recompute from lineage Replay committed log entries Failure Impact Full-stage re-execution Depends on lost partitions Minimal if quorum is maintained Availability Guarantee None Partial (driver failure = job loss) Strong (as long as majority nodes are alive) 1.5. Security and Isolation Aspect MapReduce RDD Raft (Runink) Authentication Optional Optional Mandatory (OIDC, RBAC) Secrets Management Ad hoc Ad hoc Native, Raft-backed, scoped by Herds Multi-Tenancy None None Herd isolation (namespace + cgroup enforcement) 1.6 Real case scenario example Imagine a critical pipeline for trade settlement:\nMapReduce would force every job to write to disk between stages — slow and painful for debugging. RDD would speed things up but require heavy RAM and still risk full job loss if the driver fails. Raft (Runink) keeps every contract, every transformation, every secret atomically committed and recoverable — even if a node crashes mid-run, the system can resume from the last committed stage safely. 2. Raft Advantages for Distributed Coordination Runink:\nUses Raft for strong consistency and leader election across:\nControl plane state (Herds, pipelines, RBAC, quotas) Scheduler decisions Secrets and metadata governance Guarantees:\nNo split-brain conditions Predictable and deterministic behavior in failure scenarios Fault-tolerant HA (N/2+1 consensus) Competitors:\nKubernetes uses etcd (Raft-backed), but tools like Airflow/Spark have no equivalent. Scheduling decisions, lineage, and metadata handling are often eventually consistent or stored in external systems without consensus guarantees. Result: higher complexity, latency, and coordination failure risks under scale or failure. 3. Performance \u0026 Resource Efficiency Runink:\nWritten in Go for low-latency cold starts and efficient concurrency. Uses direct exec, cgroups, and namespaces, not Docker/K8s layers. Raft ensures low-overhead coordination, avoiding polling retries and state divergence. Competitors:\nSpark is JVM-based; powerful but resource-heavy. K8s introduces orchestration latency, plus pod startup and scheduling delays. Airflow relies on Celery/K8s executors with less efficient scheduling granularity. 4. Scheduling \u0026 Resource Management Runink:\nCustom, Raft-backed Scheduler matches pipeline steps to nodes in real time. Considers Herd quotas, CPU/GPU/Memory availability. Deterministic task placement and retry logic are logged and replayable via Raft. Competitors:\nKubernetes schedulers are general-purpose and not pipeline-aware. Airflow does not control actual compute — delegates to backends like K8s. Slurm excels in HPC, but lacks pipeline-native orchestration and data governance. 5. Security Model Runink:\nSecure-by-default with OIDC + JWT, RBAC, Secrets Manager, mTLS, and field-level masking. Secrets are versioned and replicated with Raft, avoiding plaintext spillage or inconsistent states. Namespace isolation per Herd. Competitors:\nKubernetes offers RBAC and secrets, but complexity leads to misconfigurations. Airflow often shares sensitive configs (connections, variables) across DAGs. 6. Data Governance, Lineage \u0026 Metadata Runink:\nBuilt-in Data Governance Service stores contracts, lineage, quality metrics, and annotations. Changes are committed to Raft, ensuring atomic updates and rollback support. Contracts and pipeline steps are versioned and tracked centrally. Competitors:\nRequire integrating platforms like Atlas or Collibra. Lineage capture is manual or partial, with data loss possible on failure or drift. Metadata syncing lacks consistency guarantees. 7. Multi-Tenancy Runink:\nUses Herds as isolation units — enforced via RBAC, ephemeral UIDs, cgroups, and namespace boundaries. Raft ensures configuration updates (quotas, roles) are safely committed across all replicas. Competitors:\nKubernetes uses namespaces and resource quotas. Airflow has no robust multi-tenancy — teams often need separate deployments. 8. LLM Integration \u0026 Metadata Handling Runink:\nLLM inference is a first-class pipeline step. Annotations are tied to lineage and stored transactionally in the Raft-backed governance store. Competitors:\nLLMs are orchestrated as container steps via KubernetesPodOperator or Argo. Metadata is stored in external tools or left untracked. 9. Observability Runink:\nBuilt-in metrics via Prometheus, structured logs via Fluentd. Metadata and run stats are Raft-consistent, enabling reproducible audit trails. Observability spans from node → slice → Herd → run. Competitors:\nSpark, Airflow, and K8s use external stacks (Loki, Grafana, EFK) that need configuration and instrumentation. Logs may be disjointed or context-lacking. 10. Ecosystem \u0026 Maturity Runink:\nEarly-stage, but intentionally narrow in scope and highly integrated. No need for external orchestrators or data governance platforms. Competitors:\nVast ecosystems (Airflow, Spark, DBT, K8s) with huge community support. Tradeoff: Requires significant integration, coordination, and DevOps effort. 11. Complexity \u0026 Operational Effort Runink:\nHigh initial build complexity — but centralization of Raft and Go-based primitives allows for deterministic ops, easier debug, and stronger safety guarantees. Zero external dependencies once deployed. Competitors:\nOperationally fragmented. DevOps teams must manage multiple platforms (e.g., K8s, Helm, Spark, Airflow). Requires cross-tool observability, secrets management, and governance. ","2-raft-advantages-for-distributed-coordination#2.
