## 🚩 **Who It's For**

This engagement is ideal if you:

* Need a reliable foundation for analytics, reporting, or AI.

* Are launching a new data initiative and need a strong, secure starting point.
* Want expert input to validate, upgrade, or refactor your current architecture.

Our 4-week engagement typically includes:

### **Week 1: Discovery & Design**

* Stakeholder workshops to align data goals with business outcomes
* Audit of current data systems (if any)
* Roadmap proposal: stack selection, architecture, ingestion plan, governance framework

### **Week 2–3: Implementation & Integration**

* Setup or configuration of your selected data warehouse or lake
* Data pipeline creation (batch/streaming) for 1–2 key domains
* Lightweight governance setup: documentation, lineage, access control

### **Week 4: Delivery & Enablement**

* Initial reporting/dashboard layer or analytics interface
* Operational playbook with observability, cost control, and SLA guidance
* Handover session and roadmap for next-stage scaling

## 📌 **What You'll Walk Away With**

* High-trust ingestion pipelines and reliable transformation workflows
* Governance foundations: access, lineage, and documentation
* Analytics that your teams can trust — and build on

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack Philosophy**

We are **tool-agnostic** — we can:

* **Adapt** to your current tools (e.g., existing cloud provider, data warehouse, orchestration tool).
* **Recommend** a modern stack that aligns with your strategy, budget, and roadmap.
* Work across cloud-native, open-source, and enterprise solutions as needed.

Tools we commonly work with: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks, dbt, Airflow, Kafka, Spark, Looker, Tableau, Power BI — but we’re not locked in.

* Balanced focus on engineering velocity *and* governance rigor
* Strategic, hands-on approach — no bloated roadmaps, just results
* We build platforms your teams can own and scale
