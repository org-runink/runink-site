## Strengthen Your Data Foundation with our *AI & Data Maturity Readiness Assessment*.

Before investing time and resources into generative AI or large language models (LLMs), you need confidence that your data, infrastructure, and governance are ready to deliver real results. At Runink, we help data-driven executives and engineering leaders clearly understand their starting point and identify practical, strategic actions that ensure AI adoption brings real business value—not just hype.

Our ***AI & Data Maturity Readiness Assessment*** rapidly provides clarity on what needs attention, what’s ready to scale, and how your organization can responsibly unlock the full potential of AI.

This offering is ideal if your team is:

## Discovery & Vision Alignment

We begin by immersing in your unique business context to align technical goals with real-world outcomes.

#### **What we do:**

- Interview key stakeholders (product, engineering, data, risk) to surface goals and pain points  
- Review current AI initiatives, data projects, and blockers  
- Clarify business drivers for AI adoption: automation, insights, scalability, etc.  
- Align expectations between executive, operational, and compliance stakeholders  
- Document critical constraints (budget, timelines, regulatory limits)

#### **Outcome:**  

A shared vision for where AI fits — and a clear baseline for readiness across your organization.

## Data & Platform Deep Dive

Next, we evaluate the core foundations of your data and platform architecture to determine where gaps exist.

#### **What we assess:**

- Data quality, lineage, completeness, and availability  
- Integration patterns across silos (real-time vs. batch, ETL vs. ELT)  
- Storage and compute infrastructure (cloud/on-prem, orchestration tools)  
- Scalability and reliability of ML pipelines or AI workloads  
- Operational friction points (manual handoffs, tooling mismatches, lack of observability)

#### **Outcome:**  

A technical readiness profile showing where your data and infrastructure support — or limit — future AI/ML capability.

## Governance & Risk Diagnostics

We map your current controls against trusted AI and data governance frameworks to identify gaps that could create downstream risk.

#### **What we evaluate:**

- Policies for data classification, access, and retention  
- Readiness for model versioning, reproducibility, and explainability  
- Alignment with frameworks (e.g. NIST AI RMF, OECD AI Principles, internal standards)  
- Privacy and compliance posture (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, AI Act readiness)  
- AI-specific risks: hallucination, bias, drift, auditability

#### **Outcome:**  

A governance and risk posture overview with practical steps to future-proof your AI initiatives.

## Strategy Roadmap & Executive Briefing

We close the engagement by turning findings into a practical, executive-aligned roadmap — with actions, not just observations.

#### **What we deliver:**

- A detailed **maturity scorecard** across data, platform, people, and governance  
- Prioritized roadmap for foundational improvements and fast-start pilots  
- Recommendations: build, partner, or upskill — with no vendor bias  
- Executive summary briefing tailored for non-technical stakeholders  
- Optional follow-on: architecture support, pilot planning, or ongoing advisory

#### **Outcome:**  

A confident, informed strategy for responsible AI adoption tailored to your organization’s real capabilities and goals.
