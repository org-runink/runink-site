## Build a Secure, Scalable Foundation Fast with our *Cloud Infrastructure Accelerator*

Modern platforms demand modern infrastructure — but standing up secure, production-ready cloud environments can drain time, energy, and resources. Runink’s **Cloud Infrastructure Accelerator** is a rapid, guided engagement that helps engineering leaders establish a resilient, compliant cloud foundation in just a few weeks.

Whether you're migrating from legacy systems or starting from scratch, we design and implement a tailored architecture that’s built to scale — without overloading your internal team.

This accelerator is ideal for organizations that:

## What to Expect

**Effort:** Minimal disruption to your team — maximum momentum for your cloud strategy

Our **Cloud Infrastructure Accelerator** is a 3–4 week guided engagement to help your team rapidly establish a secure, production-ready foundation in AWS, GCP, or Azure — using modern DevOps, infrastructure-as-code, and compliance-first best practices.

## Cloud Foundation & Security Baselines

We start by designing and provisioning a secure cloud environment that aligns with your organization’s policies and industry best practices.

#### **What we build:**

- Landing zone design with network segmentation, subnets, NAT gateways, and routing  
- Identity & Access Management (IAM) policies and org-level guardrails  
- Encryption at rest & in transit, KMS integration, and audit logging  
- Infrastructure-as-Code setup using Terraform or CloudFormation for repeatability  
- Secure account/project structure for development, staging, and production

#### **Outcome:**  
A hardened, compliant cloud environment ready for workloads — with automation and security baked in from day one.

## Virtualization, Containers, CI/CD & Application Infrastructure

We enable rapid delivery by deploying containerized infrastructure and building the DevOps pipelines needed to support your team.

#### **What we implement:**

- Kubernetes cluster setup (EKS, GKE, or AKS) with baseline configurations  
- Dockerized deployment of your initial services or workloads  
- CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI  
- Integration with secrets management, scanning tools, and version control  
- Developer onboarding support and basic runbooks

#### **Outcome:**  
A cloud-native, automated delivery pipeline that gets your team shipping quickly and safely.

## Workload Migration & Handoff

We complete the accelerator by migrating priority workloads and equipping your team with the knowledge to run and evolve the platform.

#### **What we deliver:**

- Planning and execution of critical workload migration  
- Observability tooling: logs, metrics, alerting (CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana)  
- Cost control and resource optimization recommendations  
- Final documentation, diagrams, and environment walkthrough  
- Optional: training session or live Q&A with your engineering team

#### **Outcome:**  
Your first production-ready workloads live in the cloud — plus full visibility and control for your team to take over with confidence.
