# 🚀 Runink: Data You Can Trust. Decisions You Can Defend.

**Runink** is a platform that helps organizations build, govern, and deliver reliable data pipelines — all without managing complex infrastructure or relying solely on engineers.

> _“From raw data to responsible insights — Runink makes it simple, testable, and traceable.”_

---

## ✅ Why Runink?

- **Make faster, safer decisions**  
  Runink ensures every dataset is validated, versioned, and governed before it reaches a dashboard or model.

- **No technical skills required**  
  Define pipelines with simple, readable scenarios. No YAML, no Kubernetes, no DevOps tickets.

- **From governance to execution in one place**  
  Schema validation, access control, scheduling, observability, and lineage — all built-in.

- **Minimize risks, maximize agility**  
  Changes are testable, auditable, and rollback-friendly by default.

---

## 🧠 What You Can Do

- ✍️ **Write Scenarios, Not Scripts**  
  Describe pipeline logic in plain language (`.dsl` format), then Runink compiles and runs it.

- 🧪 **Validate and Test Every Step**  
  Built-in golden file testing, contract drift detection, and metadata snapshots for every run.

- 🔐 **Govern Access and PII Automatically**  
  Field-level tags, RBAC enforcement, and lineage all tied to your organizational roles.

- 📊 **Deliver Business-Ready Outputs**  
  Whether for analytics, finance, ML, or compliance — every result is trustworthy and traceable.

## 📌 How It Works

1. **Describe Your Scenario**
   Use our human-readable DSL to define business logic, contracts, and output requirements.

2. **Compile, Run, and Observe**
   Runink turns it into Go-native pipelines — validated, versioned, and observable.

3. **Deliver Insight**
   Trusted outputs, audit trails, and schema guarantees — ready for BI, ML, or compliance.
